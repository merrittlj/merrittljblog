## Intro
AI has held a significant position in public opinion recently, especially within the tech space. LLMs are simultaneously creating and solving problems within school environments, algorithms dictate what, where, and how we see things, and "AI" can drive cars to varying degrees of success. The term "AI" encompasses so many different sectors and technologies, and is often used purely as a buzzword; the focus of this article is to focus on the effects LLMs and intelligent technologies have as a whole on software development, and my personal view on the supposed AI crisis many think faces programmers. This is not necessarily related to any technology specifically, rather I hope to discuss these technologies in general as they relate to code itself, which is often not thought about.

## The builder
A builder wields hammers and other tools to contruct various things; have these tools remained the same throughout all of history? The form may have remained relatively similar, but the tools have of course changed. Lets assume very primitive builders used something along the lines of a rock, as compared to the contemporary hammer. If advancements in technology led to, lets say, a rock on a stick with improved ergonomics, this would naturally become the new tool over time. Yet, despite the significant change in technology(we now have a stick!), the ultimate purpose, constructing things, remains constant. 

Is the builder's value in their ability to wield a rock?

Should the builder resist this development in technology, the rock on a stick?

I would argue that the builder's value is not inherently tied up in the rock itself; anyone can wield a rock like a madman, but only few can use it to actually construct something. The builder's goal is not to use a rock well, the builder's goal is to build. When a builder goes home after a long day of work, they would not take pride in the fact that they really hit a lot of things with that rock, they would take pride in the fact that they built something.

The rock of course provides value to the builder, it helps them in their goal, but it does not define their value. If a rock on a stick would allow the builder to achieve their goal of building better, why should they remain attached to the primitive rock? Adoption of the rock on a stick is the only way to remain relevant in the industry of primitive building.

## So what?
As it may have become obvious, the builder is the modern-day software developer and the rock is code itself. What is the rock on a stick? Largely, this can apply to any technological innovation increasing developer productivity, but in this case it is AI.

I would argue that like a madman with a rock, someone who can *purely* write code has no real value. The value in a programmer
